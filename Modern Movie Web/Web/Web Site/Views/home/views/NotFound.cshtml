You should be able to find just about any movie in theaters as well as look up previously released movies by name.</p>
        <p class="large-text">If you want to return home and start over again just <a href="#!">touch here</a>. Maybe you just want to see what is currently in theaters, if so <a href="#!movies/TopBoxOffice">touch here</a>.</p>
